    "The default variable ordering leads to a BMP that is larger by more than an order of magnitude. Given this situation, it makes sense to search for the optimal variable ordering for a given function. This can be done before constructing a BMP for certain classes of functions, assuming their form known beforehand. We are more concerned with the case where the function is already represented by a BMP. In such cases, there exists an exact method of exponential complexity, which is a version of best-first search with some additional optimizations adapted to this problem. It is implemented by `exact_minimize` method in the `BMP_ordering.jl` file."
